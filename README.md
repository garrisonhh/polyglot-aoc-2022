# polyglot aoc 2022

self-imposed rules:
- new language every day
- language choices are immutable -- no deleting old solutions to implement it in a harder language, so an easier language can be used for a harder problem
    - *I am going to regret this*
- language "dialects" must be written in the idiomatic versions of each dialect
    - no typescript that is just javascript, or cpp written in the common subset of cpp and c

common project format:
- solutions should provide a shell script or clear instructions to run the program
- executable/script should accept datafile(s) in argv
- output should be printed to stdout
